    I think I keep postponing everything<br>
because finishing things means facing myself again.<br>

I’ve been running.<br>
No, not the jog in the park<br>
but the silent sprint away from my unread emails,<br>
the piled-up dishes,<br>
and the voice in my head that keeps saying,<br>
“You’re falling behind.”<br>

I rearranged my bookshelf instead of doing the thing.<br>
I rearranged my pens.<br>
I made tea I didn’t drink.<br>
And told myself<br>
this is productivity too.<br>

And when I woke up,<br>
the sun had moved across the room<br>
like it, too, wanted nothing to do with me.<br>

But I know the truth<br>
I am hiding inside small rituals,<br>
because the big ones scare me.<br>

The showing up,<br>
the facing things,<br>
the trying when I already feel too tired<br>
it all feels like asking my lungs<br>
to breathe underwater.<br>

I tell myself I’ll start tomorrow.<br>
Tomorrow is my religion<br>
always holy, waiting,<br>
always forgiving me<br>
for the things I didn’t do today.<br>

There’s some kind of art in avoidance.<br>
A poetry in pretending.<br>
A rhythm in saying<br>
“I’m just tired,”<br>
when I’m really just scared<br>
to show up,<br>
to fail,<br>
to be seen.<br>

My responsibilities knock like polite strangers.<br>
And I hide like a child behind the couch,<br>
holding my breath,<br>
hoping they leave a note and go.<br>

Still,<br>
for now,<br>
I lie still,<br>
making friends with the dust on my desk<br>
the undone,<br>
the untouched,<br>
the undone again.<br>

I promise I’ll show up.<br>
Just…<br>
not today.<br>

Maybe tomorrow, I’ll finally water the plant.<br>
Maybe I’ll write back.<br>
Maybe I’ll stop hiding.<br>

I keep running from my responsibilities,<br>
but they always know my address.<br>
